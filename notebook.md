## Blocks
Hat Block	- A block with a rounded top used to start a stack of blocks and attach blocks below to begin a project. Belongs at the top.

Stack / Command Block	- A block with an indentation at the top left side and a bump out the bottom left side. These perform main commands and are shaped to attach above or below other stack blocks.

C-Block - A block with a "C" shape that wraps around other stack blocks. It's used to loop a specific order of blocks or check if a condition is true or false

Reporter / Oval Block	- A block shaped like a wide oval with rounded edges. Report values in the form of numbers and fits inside any blocks with oval inputs for other blocks.

Boolean / Hexagonal Block - A block with pointed ends. It returns a condition as either true or false and fits inside any blocks with hexagonal (six-sided) inputs for other blocks.

Repeat Block - A 'C' block that repeats the blocks contained inside for a set number of times. The repeat 'C' block can accept integers or numeric blocks.

Wait Until Block - A command block that waits for a Boolean block to report true before moving to the next block. The Wait Until Boolean block can accept hexagonal (six-sided) shaped blocks.

If Then Block - A 'C' Block that runs the blocks inside, if the Boolean condition is reported to be true. If the Boolean condition is reported as true, the blocks inside of if then will run.

Forever Block - A 'C' block that repeats any blocks contained inside forever. Programmers use this block to create a continuous loop of a sequence of blocks and commands.

## Markdown Style Guide for Coding Notebooks

Follow this guide to keep your coding notebook **clear, consistent, and professional**.  

This ensures your notes are easy for you (and others) to read later.

---

## Headings

**When to use:** Organize your notebook into sections (like days, topics, or projects).  

- `#` for the notebook title (use once at the top).  

- `##` for each day or major topic.  

- `###` for subsections (like "Notes", "Practice", "Reflections").  

# Example:

# My Coding Notebook

## Day 1

### Notes

### Practice

# Text Formatting

When to use: Highlight important ideas or add emphasis.

Use bold for key terms or definitions.

Use italic for emphasis or side comments.

Use inline code for keywords, functions, or commands.

 

# Example:

**Class** = a blueprint for objects  

*Remember:* always test your code  

Use `System.out.println()` to print

 

# Code Blocks

When to use: Anytime you write multiple lines of code.

Inline code for short snippets.

Fenced code blocks with language for full examples.

# Example:

```java

public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Hello World!");

    }

}

```

# Lists

When to use: Organize steps, notes, or key points.

Numbered lists for sequences or steps.

Bulleted lists for unordered ideas.

# Example:

Define the class
Write the main method
Test your program
Variables

- Loops

- Conditionals

 

# Checklists

When to use: Track progress on assignments or tasks.

# Example:

[x] Complete coding warm-up

- [ ] Finish project draft

- [ ] Reflect on learning

 

# Blockquotes

When to use: Call out notes, reminders, or teacher comments.

# Example:

> 💡 Remember: Loops repeat code until a condition is false.

 

# Tables

When to use: Compare values, track progress, or organize data neatly.

# Example:

| Task        | Status   | Notes          |

|--------------|------------|-----------------| 

| Homework 1  | Done #  | Submitted      |

| Homework 2  | Pending  | Needs review   |

 

# Links & Images

When to use: Add references, resources, or visuals.

# Example:

[Java Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/)  

![Markdown Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Markdown-mark.svg)

To make an image that is a link, paste the image, then add the following before it, replacing website address with the link:

<a href="website address">

And after the image info, add: </a>

# Collapsible Sections

When to use: Hide solutions, extended notes, or extra details.

# Example:

<details>

  <summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>

  

System.out.println("Answer: 42");

</details>

 

# Footnotes

When to use: Add references or side notes without cluttering the page.

# Example:

This concept is related to object-oriented programming.[^1]

[^1]: See "Objects and Classes" in your textbook.

 

# Style Rules

Consistency matters more than creativity

Always use headings to structure your notes.

Always use code blocks for multi-line code.

Clarity first

Bold key terms.

Use lists instead of long sentences when outlining steps.

Professional tone

Don’t mix casual notes with formal work in the same section.

Use blockquotes for reflections or teacher feedback.

Track your learning

Use checklists to mark what’s done.

Use collapsible sections if you want to hide answers until review time.

 

# Bottom Line:

Headings = Structure

Bold/Italic = Emphasis

Code blocks = Code

Lists = Steps/Ideas

Tables = Organization

Checklists = Progress

Blockquotes = Notes/Tips

Collapsible = Hide/Show detail

Keep it simple, consistent, and clear.
